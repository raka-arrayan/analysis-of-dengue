# Analysis Of Dengue 

This data processing aims to develop prediction models that can help in early detection dengue fever infections based on clinical and demographic data.
By using machine learning techniques, This model is expected to:
1 Predict dengue fever infections with high accuracy.
2. Identify the main factors that cause a person to become infected with dengue fever.
3. Increase the efficiency of early detection of dengue cases.
4. create a prediction model that can determine whether someone suffers from dengue fever (Outcome = 1) or not (Outcome = 0) based on the data
5.Know the best Machine Learning Algorithms for data modeling and classification
